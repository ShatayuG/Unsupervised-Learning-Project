# Unsupervised-Learning-Project
Unsupervised ML is particularly useful when you don't have the labels of the data. It leads to the pattern recognisation and
whole lot of other things like clustering and recommendation system. In this project, I have used K Means Clustering to make different cluster for 
marketing purpose of a credit card company. To find optimal number of clusters I have used elbow method and Silhoutte coefficient
to find optimal number of clusters to be formed in this data.
To visualise the output I have reduced the dimensionality using PCA algorithm into a 2D space.
